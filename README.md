# Tucil1 - IF2211 Strategi Algoritma

## General Information
Program created with C++ to fulfill "Tugas Kecil 1 Stima 2022/2023". The program is built to solve 24 card game using brute force. 24 is a card game that uses a standard deck of playing cards, 
in which players attempt to create mathematical equations that equal 24 using the four cards dealt to them. Each card is assigned a numerical value (Aces are 1, Jack are 11, Queen are 12, King are 13 and all other cards are their face value), 
and players can use any mathematical operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) to try to reach 24 with the four cards they've been dealt. The input can be given by user or auto-generate. 
The output will be all possible combination of solution and also can be store in an external ".txt" file.
